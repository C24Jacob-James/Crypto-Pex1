""" CryptoPex1.py
Name: Jacob M. James
Date: 22 March 2024
Purpose: Factor large numbers using Brute Force, Pollards_rho, and dixons
Documentation: I used Chat GPT to give me an outline for the start of the project. 
    I used this website to give me the code for Dixon's algorithm: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dixons-factorization-method-with-implementation/
    I then asked ChatGPT to make the code and variables more readable. I asked Chat GPT to create the timer functionality for me for all of the 
    algorithms and I asked it to refactor Dixon' for me.
