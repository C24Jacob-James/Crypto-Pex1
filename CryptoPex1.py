Purpose: Factor large numbers using Brute Force, Pollards_rho, and dixons
Documentation: I used Chat GPT to give me the start of the project. I just asked it for the skeleton code and none of the implementations. 
    I used this website to give me the code for Dixon's algorithm: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dixons-factorization-method-with-implementation/
